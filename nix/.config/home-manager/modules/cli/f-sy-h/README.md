Place the fast-syntax-highlighting plugin here if you vendor it.

This directory is symlinked to `~/.config/f-sy-h` via Home Manager using an out-of-store symlink.

If you prefer, you can instead install `zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting` via Nix and adjust your Zsh config to source it from the Nix store.
